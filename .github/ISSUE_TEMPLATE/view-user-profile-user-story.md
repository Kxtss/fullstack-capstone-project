**As a** user,
**I need** to view a user's profile
**So that** I can see their information and gifts.

### Details and Assumptions

    - The user's profile will show the user's image, name, and description.
    - The profile will also display the list of gifts the user has posted.

### Acceptance Criteria

    Given I am on the home or search page and I see a gift posted by another user,
    When I click on the user's name or profile picture,
    Then I am navigated to their profile page, which displays their personal information and a list of their posted gifts.
