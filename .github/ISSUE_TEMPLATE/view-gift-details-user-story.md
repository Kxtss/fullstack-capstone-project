**As a** user,
**I need** to view the details of a specific gift
**So that** I can decide if I want to acquire it or learn more about it.

### Details and Assumptions

    - The details page will show the gift's image, name, category, condition, description, and comments.
    - The user can add comments on the item.

### Acceptance Criteria

    Given I am on the home or search page and I see a gift I like,
    When I click the "View Details" button for that gift,
    Then I am taken to a new page that displays all the details of the gift.
