**As a** user,
**I need** to be able to comment on a gift
**So that** I can ask questions or share my thoughts about the item.

### Details and Assumptions

    - The user must be logged in to post a comment.
    - Comments are visible to all users on the gift's details page.
    - The comment should be displayed with the user's name and the comment text.

### Acceptance Criteria

    Given I am viewing the details page of a gift,
    When I type a comment in the comment box and click "Post,"
    Then my new comment appears at the bottom of the comments list with my user name.
