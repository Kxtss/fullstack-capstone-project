**As a** user,
**I need** to filter my search results
**So that** I can narrow down my options and find the perfect gift.

### Details and Assumptions

    - The filter options should include categories, condition, and possibly age.
    - The filters should work in conjunction with the search bar.

### Acceptance Criteria

    Given I have searched for "toys" and see a list of results,
    When I apply a filter for "new" condition,
    Then the displayed results update to show only the toys that are in "new" condition.
