# Feature: Research Authentication

**As a** developer,
**I need** to research different authentication methods for React and Express
**So that** I can choose the most secure and scalable solution for the application.

### Details and Assumptions

    - This task does not directly provide a new user-facing feature.
    - The goal is to evaluate different libraries or services (e.g., Passport.js, JWT, Auth0) for user authentication.
    - The research should lead to a clear recommendation for implementation.

### Acceptance Criteria

    Given the developer has completed the research,
    When the developer presents their findings to the team,
    Then the team agrees on an authentication strategy and a plan for implementation.
