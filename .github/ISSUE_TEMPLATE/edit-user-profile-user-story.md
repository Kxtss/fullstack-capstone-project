**As a** logged-in user,
**I need** to be able to edit my profile information
**So that** I can keep my personal details and gifts up to date.

### Details and Assumptions

    - The user can edit their name, description, and profile picture.
    - The user must be logged in to access and edit their profile.
    - The changes should be saved and reflected on their profile page.

### Acceptance Criteria

    Given I am on my profile page,
    When I click the "Edit Profile" button and update my name and description,
    Then the page reloads with my new information displayed, and a success message is shown.
